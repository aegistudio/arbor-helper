# arbor-helper
A wrapper for arbor helper, make development easier.

<b>IMPORTANT: </b>Before you will setup for your website or watch the demo, make sure you have obtain <i>arborjs</i> and put <i>arbor.js</i> and <i>arbor-tween.js</i> under script folder.

The repository of arborjs: https://github.com/samizdatco/arbor (Both required files are under <i>lib</i> directory)

### Why a helper?
The arborjs is ideal for simulation but it's not easy to use barely.

From my perspective, these factors hinder it from being easily used:
- Need to write view (renderer) your own.
- Need to write controller (receiving mouse input / window resize) on your own.
- Adding nodes and edges directively.

So I write a helper for projects built on arborjs.
It would be surely easier than writing from scratch.
